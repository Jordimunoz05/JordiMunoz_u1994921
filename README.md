## Project analysis

### User profile / persona

This site is designed for two very clear audiences. The first is a time-pressed recruiter or HR generalist who screens dozens of applications per day. This person expects instant clarity: a strong identity block (name, role, location, contact), a quick sense of my profile, and friction-less navigation to experience, education, projects, and skills. For them I surface identity and contact in the hero and keep the whole page as a single, scrollable document with anchored navigation. The second audience is a technical reviewer (engineer, team lead, or hiring manager) who wants signal over noise. This person expects specifics—what I built, how I worked, and evidence of technical growth—so I provide project cards, concrete achievements in each role, and a skills area that visualizes proficiency in a compact, scannable way. Both audiences now get fast orientation from the fixed top navigation, which collapses elegantly on mobile, and temporarily hides after the hero to maximize content focus while scrolling back up restores it for quick jumps between sections.

### Information architecture

I chose a single-page layout so the whole CV reads as a cohesive narrative while remaining jump-navigable through anchored links in the fixed top bar. The sequence is deliberate. First, the hero presents identity (name and role) plus a short description and contact/social actions; this block forms the “elevator pitch” and establishes credibility immediately. Under the hero, About Me introduces my story and strengths in a two-column composition: text on the left and a right column for abilities and interests, making soft skills and personal motivations discoverable without overwhelming the page. The Experience section follows as role-based cards with titles, company, dates/location, a concise description, and “Key achievements”. Non-IT roles exist but are tucked behind a “See more” control to keep the primary story focused; they can be revealed or hidden on demand to match the reviewer’s intent. Education & Certifications appears next, split into two columns to separate academic credentials from short-form learning while maintaining symmetry and easy scanning. Digital Creations highlights selected work as visual cards, each with a short description and tech tags. Skills & Extra Information closes the main content with compact progress bars that animate into view for a quick proficiency overview. Finally, Contact provides a clean, centered form card so reaching out is always one scroll away. Across all sections I cap line-lengths with a 1000px inner container and alternate neutral backgrounds to create distinct, breathable bands that guide the eye down the page without visual

### Visual Design

I use a restrained palette to keep the content professional and legible: a soft gray band #F9FAFB alternates with white for section backgrounds, while a confident accent blue #517EF0 carries interactive elements and emphasis (navigation pills, chips, progress fills, underline markers). This balance keeps the page clean and modern while providing enough contrast to guide attention. Typography is Inter throughout (300–700) for consistency across headings, paragraphs, and UI labels; Inter’s x-height, rhythm, and hinting perform well on screens and support the minimalist aesthetic I’m targeting. The layout centers the content with a 1000px max-width and generous vertical spacing, so sections breathe and scanning feels effortless. Visual components repeat a small set of patterns to build recognition: rounded “pill” buttons in the navbar and tags, soft-cornered cards for experience, education, projects, and contact, and a short blue line beneath each section title to create a subtle anchor for the eye. On mobile, the menu converts to a simple toggle while preserving the same visual language. Motion is minimal and purposeful: the top bar hides after the hero to increase reading focus, “show more/hide” reveals secondary experience gracefully, and skill bars animate from zero to their target width as they enter view, respecting reduced-motion preferences when set by the user. The result is a calm, credible visual system that foregrounds my work rather than the frame around it.
